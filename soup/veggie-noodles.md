#Veggie Noodles with Instant Pot Tomato Sauce
*Serves 4 with about 4 cups sauce leftover*

This recipe will be ready in about 40 minutes and will give you a generous amount of sauce, plenty for meals later in the week.

##Ingredients:

* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 carrot, shredded
* 1/2 small onion, diced
* 2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* 1 Parmigiano Reggiano rind (optional)
* 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 pound (about 6 cups) veggie noodles, such as zucchini, butternut squash or carrot noodles
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 cup basil or parsley leaves, thinly sliced or chopped

##Directions:

Set an Instant Pot to high saut√© setting. Add oil, garlic, carrot and onion and cook, stirring, until vegetables are just softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, vinegar, Parmigiano Reggiano rind (if using), pepper flakes, thyme, oregano, salt and pepper. Set the pot to high pressure and make sure the pressure valve is in the "seal" position. Set timer to 25 minutes. Press start. When cooking is complete, allow pressure to release naturally. Open pot and discard rind, if using.

Place veggie noodles in a steamer basket and set over simmering water. Cook until heated through and tender, 2 to 5 minutes depending on type of vegetable. Divide noodles between bowls and top each bowl with about 2/3 cup tomato sauce and sprinkle with basil. Extra sauce will keep refrigerated for 3 to 4 days or frozen up to 6 months.
