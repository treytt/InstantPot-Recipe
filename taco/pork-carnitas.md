# Citrusy Pork Carnitas in Cabbage Leaf "Tacos"
**Serves 8**

Juicy pork carnitas make for a great paleo-friendly filling. Wrap the tender meat in colorful red cabbage and add your choice of fresh garnishes.

## Ingredients:

* 2 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 3 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 3-inch cubes
* 1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
* 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
* 6 garlic cloves
* 1 jalapeño pepper
* 1 large head red cabbage
* Garnishes of choice: shredded cabbage, diced onion, pico de gallo, cilantro, diced avocado and lime wedges


## Directions

In a cup, combine chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt and pepper. Sprinkle half of the spice mixture over all sides of the pork. Set an Instant Pot to the high sauté setting. Add oil; add pork and cook, turning chunks occasionally, until very browned on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour in orange juice and lime juice and add garlic, jalapeño and remaining spice mixture. Set the Instant Pot to high pressure and make sure the pressure valve is in the "seal" position. Set timer to 35 minutes. Press start.

Meanwhile, preheat oven broiler to high and position rack at the top of the oven. Cut the cabbage in half lengthwise. Peel leaves from each half, discarding the core, and wash and dry each cabbage leaf to use for the taco shells. When cooking is complete, allow pressure to release naturally (about 15 minutes). Use a slotted spoon to transfer the pork to a rimmed baking sheet and shred with two forks. Place under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes to crisp up the edges. (Watch it like a hawk and don’t walk away!) Remove, toss the pork with some of the remaining juices, then broil again for just 2 to 3 minutes this time. You want a combination of crispy pork and tender, juicy morsels. Just before serving, drizzle more cooking liquid over the carnitas and serve hot, stuffed in crunchy cabbage shells and topped with garnishes of choice
